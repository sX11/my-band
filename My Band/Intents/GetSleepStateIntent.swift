// MARK: - GetSleepStateIntent
//
// "Você está dormindo?" — the Shortcuts-native replacement for the Home Assistant "sono
// detectado" trigger that was cut from the roadmap. Instead of the app owning an automation
// (turn off the bedroom lights, run a script), it just answers this question; the user's own
// Shortcuts Personal Automation decides what to do with the answer.
//
// The band has no "fell asleep"/"woke up" push (see CLAUDE.md's BLE protocol notes) — sleep is
// always pull, discovered whenever the app happens to sync. So "is he sleeping" can only ever be
// "as of the last sync", never truly real-time. This intent narrows that gap by forcing a sync
// first (best-effort — a failed sync isn't fatal, it just falls back to whatever's already known)
// and is honest about it: the dialog always states how old the underlying data is, so a Shortcut
// chaining off this isn't silently acting on a stale answer.
