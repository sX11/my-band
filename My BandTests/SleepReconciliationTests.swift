// Regression coverage for the sleep double-counting bug found via a real Apple Health export:
// resyncing a still-in-progress (or previously partial) night reported the same real stage with a
// later end each time, and multiple files for the same/overlapping night could land in one batch —
// neither case was sanitized against the other, so Apple Health accumulated overlapping,
// double-counted stage and in-bed intervals. `sanitizeStages` (per-session) and
// `HealthKitManager.groupOverlapping` + the pooled re-sanitize in `writeSleep` fix this together.
