// Process-wide owner of the long-lived managers (BLE, sync, customization, scale) and the single
// place that wires them together. Created and bootstrapped from the launch path — the AppDelegate on
// iOS, the App initializer elsewhere — NOT from a SwiftUI .onAppear.
//
// Why not .onAppear: a CoreBluetooth state-restoration relaunch (the band coming back in range) or a
// BGTask launch has no visible scene, so .onAppear never fires. The previous design wired everything
// in .onAppear, which meant that on such a headless launch BandSyncer.onAuthenticated was never set
// and BackgroundSyncManager had no dependencies — the band could reconnect but nothing ever synced.
// Bootstrapping from the launch path fixes that and guarantees the CBCentralManager (with its restore
// identifier) is instantiated early enough to receive willRestoreState.
