// Writes Mi Band data to Apple Health. Deduplication uses HKMetadataKeySyncIdentifier +
// HKMetadataKeySyncVersion: re-saving a sample with the same identifier and an equal/greater
// version replaces the existing one instead of creating a duplicate — so re-syncing is safe.
//
// Cross-source reconciliation (steps / distance / active energy). The iPhone's motion
// coprocessor writes these same quantities, and Apple Health *sums* every third-party source on
// top of the iPhone instead of merging them (its private iPhone+Watch dedup does not extend to
// third parties, and there's no API to influence the aggregation). So writing the band's totals
// raw would double-count a shared walk. Instead `writeReconciledActivity` writes only the band's
// *surplus* over what the iPhone already recorded for the same minute — net total per minute =
// max(band, iPhone). That kills the double count, keeps the iPhone's Mobility metrics (Walking
// Asymmetry, Step Length, etc., which the band can't produce and which need Fitness Tracking on),
// and still captures steps taken without the phone. SpO₂ stays out of this — the iPhone has no
// such sensor, so it's written at full per-minute granularity in `writeMinuteSamples`.
